#  Crux_Engine

**Crux_Engine** is an evolving, modular graphics engine being built from scratch in C++. Currently focused on graphics (with Vulkan), this project aspires to grow into a full-featured **game engine**, implementing:

-  ECS (Entity Component System)
-  Game Physics Engine
-  Game Networking
-  Scripting Support
-  Linear & 3D Audio
-  GUI & Gizmo Systems
-  Basic Modeling Tools

> If there's enough community interest and contribution, the vision will expand further into a full production-ready framework for game developers and engine enthusiasts alike.
